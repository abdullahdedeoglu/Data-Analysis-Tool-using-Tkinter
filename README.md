# Data-Analysis-Tool-using-Tkinter
This Python script creates a simple data analysis tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. The tool is designed to perform various statistical operations on a dataset using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries.

# Functionality:
Data Visualization:
Loads data from an Excel file and displays it in a table format using a Treeview widget.

Data Summary:
Calculates statistical measures (mean, median, mode, frequency, quartiles, outliers, variance, standard deviation) for the selected 
column.

Data Cleaning:
Handles missing values by replacing them with the column's mean.

Graphical Representations:
Displays a box plot and a bar plot for the selected column.
# Operations:

Open Data File:
Open an Excel file containing the dataset.

Data Summary:
Enter the column number to generate a statistical summary for that specific column.

Data Cleaning:
Remove missing values by replacing them with the column's mean.

# Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Tkinter library (GUI)
Pandas library (Data manipulation)
NumPy library (Numerical operations)
Matplotlib library (Data visualization)

# Usage:

Execution:

Run the Python script.

Data Load:
Use the "Open Spreadsheet" option from the menu to load the dataset.

Data Summary:
Enter the column number and click "Veri Ã–zeti" to see statistical measures.

Missing Data Handling:
Click "Eksik Veri Temizle" to handle missing values in the dataset.

Graphical Representations:
Box plot and bar plot will be displayed for the selected column.

# Notes:
The program provides a user-friendly interface for basic data analysis and visualization tasks.
It enables users to perform statistical operations on columns within the loaded dataset.
